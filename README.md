# getCarDetailsByVIN function:

-Takes a vin (Vehicle Identification Number) as input.
-Replace API_URL with the actual endpoint URL of the automotive API you plan to use. You might need an API key for certain APIs, include it in the request accordingly.
-Uses axios.get to make an asynchronous API call.
-Parses the response data to extract car details based on the specific API's response format (replace placeholders -with actual property names).
-Returns an object containing the extracted car details (or null on errors).
-Error handling: Demonstrates basic error handling using a try...catch block. In a real application, you'd want more robust error handling.

## Example usage:
- Shows how to call the function with a sample VIN number.
- Uses then to handle the successful response, extracting and logging the retrieved car details (make, model, year).
- Includes logic to handle cases where the API call fails.
